## New version !

This folder was changed as there was only 3 source files, now there exists **V1_SOURCE** and **V2_SOURCE** where the **V1** contains the original files (not recommended to use), and the **V2** contains the new version of the project that adapts an **OOP** approach and a cleaner code structure, as well as some enhancements along with some new features.

**What's new?**

- Rotation isn't continuous, instead it's a fixed amount of rotation
- The canvas's color could be changed
- The filling could be turned ON and OFF and the color could be customized
- The line color could be customized

## Description

This project was made as a practice for Python programming, Matrix maniulation, file processing, and general system engineering processes.

Also it was a way for me to explore an interesting field for me which is graphics (2D, and 3D).

It's a desktop app that takes in waveform files (.OBJ) and visualizes its triangulated form (no filliing, no shading, no texturing! just triangles)

### Key Words

- Python: Numpy, Tkinter, re (regex), PIL.

- Waveform (.OBJ).

## Disclamer

This article assumes having basic knowledge of Python, Tkinter, and Numpy, since these will not be covered here.

## Waveform files (.OBJ)

I recommend reading this [article in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file).

Or if you're not into reading, watch this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMWUjNE0fYI)

## How to use

### Dependecies:

You'll have to have these libraries along with Python in your PC:

- Numpy

- Tkinter (if you're running Linux, you'll have to install it, otherwise, it comes with Python when installed)

- The 3 files provided in this repo located in the same folder.

- pyscreenshot (Only if you're running Linux, otherwise, you can use ImageGrab from the PIL lib)

### Manipulation

- Run the main.py file

- This interface will open:

- You can load any .obj file you want, or you can choose from the files 
provided in the /Objects folder.

- After loading the 3D model, you can move it UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT using the U/D/L/R buttons or using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

- You can zoom in and out, or rotate the model in 3 axis.

- You can take screenshots too with the "Take screenshot" button.
